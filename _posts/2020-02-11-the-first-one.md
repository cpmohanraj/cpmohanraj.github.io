Okay! I started a course on Udemy to learn about and prepare for an Azure architect certification. As I was listening, there were thoughts that were pondering in my mind. It made me think about my thinking process and thoughts. They were random at best but some of them were valuable. So here I am, attempting to log them which I expect would help me in the future.

Thoughts here, are just my opinion, and do not reflect the companies I work for.
