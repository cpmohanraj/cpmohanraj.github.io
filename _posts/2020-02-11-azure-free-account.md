title: "Azure Free Account"

As part of Udemy course for AZ-300, I had set up a separate email account and registered to use Azure services for free for first month. This was more than a month ago and ofcourse I lost the opportunity to use the free account. I thought of setting up a new account and try getting Azure services free for first month. And Microsoft wants you to provide credit card details for verification to use free service just like Netflix and other online services. {and my mind did think about why would these companies want my credit card to provide free service. could it be to avoid abuse of their free services? but could it be to make some money from absent-minded/lazy people who forgets to cancel them on-time)

Anyway, my attempt to use the free month by creating a new account didn't work. I gave up and ended up just going with PayYouGo subscription. After all, one of the USP for cloud solutions is the low cost and I am confident that I could set budget alerts in Azure to avoid cost overruns.

Also I figued out that Microsoft provides free VMs (and other services) for evey account [Azure Free Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-free-services).
